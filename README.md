Personal Verilog practice for HDLBits â€” not official, not a guide. Do it yourself!

## ðŸ”’ Disclaimer

These are **my self-practice Verilog implementations** based on problems from HDLBits.  
This repository is **not affiliated with or endorsed by HDLBits** in any way.  

I **highly recommend** you try to solve the problems on your own.  
This is **not a guide or shortcut** to complete HDLBits â€” it's just my personal learning archive.
