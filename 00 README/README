I have completed 156 problems in HDLBits, all posted in order. I shared them to showcase my work,
not for copy-pasting. Please try solving them yourself to gain the real benefit.

These are my self-practice Verilog implementations based on problems from HDLBits.
This repository is not affiliated with or endorsed by HDLBits in any way.

I highly recommend you try to solve the problems on your own.
This is not a guide or shortcut to complete HDLBits â€” it's just my personal learning archive.
